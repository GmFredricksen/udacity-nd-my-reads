# 🤓📚☕️ MyReads Project

Final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

⛓ [**View my Demo**](https://udacity-gm-reads.herokuapp.com/)

To get started developing:

* clone this repo and `cd` into it
* install all project dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn`)
* start the development server with `npm start` (or `yarn start`)

If everything went smoothly you can now open and view the application at `localhost:3000` on your local machine and interact with it (if it hasn't already opened automatically).

## 🔎 Search Functionality
The search queries are limited to [`this list of words`](SEARCH_TERMS.md).
However, remember that the [`BooksAPI.search()`](src/utils/BooksAPI.js#L33) method DOES search by title or author.
So, don't worry if you don't find a specific author or title.

## ⚙️ Backend Server
For more info about the [`BooksAPI.js`](src/utils/BooksAPI.js) provided for development please refer to the [`react nanodegree starter project`](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

### 📓 Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [`Create React App`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and integrated with some of the materials provided by the [`react nanodegree starter project`](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).
